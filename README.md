# LastWeekendApp
This app built in 4 days as a part of a learning course during my time at a coding bootcamp. Many of the features are not compelte due to the very short timeline, and not necessarily due to lack of knowledge. 
A social networking app that has a heavy focus on sharing your times outdoors doing what you love and a very little focus on comments and following people.
Rather than following people, you will follow scenes
Posts get automaically removed from explore feeds after 7 days, so all posts you see will be from "last weekend".
comments are only displayed on a hover and do not take you to a different view like other social sites do. Again, the focus in on the actual content, not the comments. 
Lots of features are still in development such as the "scene" feature that will allow you to follow certain sports and activities instead of people. 
Development of a weather and get together orginising feature is coming down the pipeline.
